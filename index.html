	<h1>GameDeal Hunt</h1>

	<p>Hello, and welcome.  So you've found our secret page... if only it were that easy.</p>
	<p>There are a number of puzzles to complete before you can claim to have won.  Think you're ready?</p>
	<p>There may even be something sweet in it for you if you can make it to the end, assuming you're quick enough.</p>

	<h3>Some ground rules</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>To get to the next level, simply update the page name (before .html) in the address bar.</li>
		<li>All page names will be lowercase and without spaces or special characters.</li>
		<li>You'll need a modern browser with Javascript.</li>
		<li>Your reddit account needs to be at least 1 day old.</li>
		<li>We understand wanting to help friends out, but please don't share your answers.  We have limited prizes to give away, and want to reward those that complete the puzzles genuinely.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>There's three branches: trivia, computer science, and mathematics.  All lead to the same destination, but test your skills in different ways.  You're encouraged to try them all!</p>
