	<p>We do need to verify your reddit account first.  This just lets us check your account's age, and proves you're the owner of your account.  Our access will expire in one hour, or you can <a href="https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/" target="_blank">manually revoke</a> after verification.</p>
	<p>Our request: <em>Please don't share this URL</em>.  I know we could add all sorts of protections and IP checks to try to protect against cheaters, but much like DRM in games this is likely to only cause problems for real users.  Our prizes are limited, so we thank you for playing fair.</p>
